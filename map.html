    <h2>Hotspot Map</h2>
    <p>This map shows the weekly prevalence, per 100,000 population, of COVID-19 across the UK for the
    last seven days that reliable data is available.</p>

    <p>The "â†•" button switches the map to show the weekly change in cases per capita.</p>

    <p>You can click on an area on the map to see the current numbers and a history of the last 45 days of daily cases.</p>
    <div class="warning">
  <p>
    Note that, starting around the second week of September, demand for tests has exceeded capacity.
    Flattening off of cases should be viewed with scepticism, and compared with hospital admissions
    and NHS triage statistics.

  <p>Data is reported by date of sample, which means that some cases may be missing for the most
  recent few days. When calculating the weekly prevalence, the most recent 7 days of data are ignored unless they would
      cause the prevalence number to increase. This allows spikes in cases to be detected early.</p>
